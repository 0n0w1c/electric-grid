Translate the following Factorio mod locale file into the target language.

Rules:

Follow official Factorio localization for the target language.
Before translating, infer the correct equivalents for all game concepts (e.g., mining drill, pumpjack, ore, tiles, recipes, blueprints, etc.) from the style used in the base game’s official localization.
Do not create new terminology unless the game itself does.

Interpret mod-specific prefixes by meaning, not literally.
The word “Transformator” in names refers to a mod concept, not an English word that should appear in the translation.
It is a transformer like in-game entity provided by this mod. Much of this is concerning electric poles and their properties.
Translate such prefixes using a natural, internally consistent term that expresses the intended gameplay behavior (e.g., self-generating, auto-loading).
Choose one term and apply it consistently across all items.

Preserve the locale keys exactly.
Only translate the text after each =.

Maintain full consistency across all translated strings:

consistent naming of machines and variants

consistent capitalization

consistent grammatical structure

consistent terminology for descriptions, GUI labels, and messages

Do not add or remove meaning.
Translate precisely while adapting naturally to the target language’s grammar and style.

Return the translated locale file only, with no commentary.

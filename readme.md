Electric Grid:  
A Factorio 2.0 mod to bring more structure to the electric network.  
See license.txt for credits to the developers and their work that came before me.  
A special thanks to Stringweasel for his work on Fluidic Power, the inspiration.  

Important notes:
This is a work in progress, in the proof of concept stage, but believed to be reasonably playable.  
This mod should only be added to a new or early games, it significantly modifies the electric poles.  

May not be useful or functional on Fulgora (to be determined, possible future development).  
The wiring rules should still be valid. However, the use of transformators, maybe not so much.  

Adds:  
Transformators (ctrl + left-click to select power rating)  
Huge electric pole (lighted)  
Underground substations  

Removes:  
Power switch  

Changes:  
Small poles are the new medium poles  
Medium, big and huge poles have no supply area, used for power tranmission only  

New wiring rules:  
Small poles can connect to small and medium poles  
Medium poles can connect to small and medium poles  
Big poles can connect to big poles, substations and underground substations  
Huge poles can connect to huge poles  
Substations and underground substations can only connect to big poles  
Transformators can only connect to medium, big and huge poles  

Small poles and substations are for power distribution and collection  
Medium, big and huge poles are for power transmission only  

Objective:  
Build an electric network infrastructure that more closely follows the Factorio way:  
Build a main power grid using huge poles, to operate similar to a main bus.  
Transformators separate the high voltage main bus from low voltage distribution, think splitters.  
Medium, big and huge poles transmit power, function is similar to that of belts.  
Small poles and substations function as the inserters.
